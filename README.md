# Data Structures and Algorithms TDDE22
Course covering implementation, usage, time complexity and memory allocation of various data structures and algorithms including: Queue, stack, array, arraylist, maps, trees, hashmaps, binary search trees, AVL trees, Splay trees, priority queu, min and max heaps, mergesort, quicksort, graphs, bredth first search, depth first search, minimum spanning tree, dijkstra's, kruskal's...

# Lab 1 
Implemented a dictionary using a closed hash table with collision handling using. We used a linear probing sequence, but a non linear probing sequence with relative prime step size against the total table size would be preferable to prevent clusters to form. Also examined collision probability.

## Implemented files
- SymbolTable.java

# Lab 2
Implemented a self balancing binary search tree (AVL tree). Implemented functions for insertion and removal in tree, including functionality for balancing the AVL tree automatically by detecting improper tree balancing and adjusting with left/right rotate and dubble rotate.

## Implemented files
- AvlTreeNode.java

# Lab 3
Optimized an algorithm that finds all lines through points in a coordinate system. Used hashmaps with the slope as the key to efficiently store and lookup pairs of nodes.

## Implemented files
- SlopeNode.java
- Fast.java

# Lab 4
Uses breath first search to find the longest shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Implemented files
- LongestChain.java

# Lab X
Optimizes a particle simulation algorithm using min-heap implementation.

## Implemented files
- MinPQ.java
